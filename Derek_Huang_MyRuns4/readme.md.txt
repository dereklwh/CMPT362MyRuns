# My Runs Assignment 3
- took inspiration from room demo for: ExerciseEntryDatabase.kt, ExerciseViewModel.kt, and ExerciseEntryDatabase.kt
- Unit conversion in history fragment only takes place if app is reset
- Continuation of MyRuns1 and MyRuns2, so it is still in the application called "MyRuns1"

# My Runs Assignment 2
- Used prof code for "MyFragmentStateAdapter" class
- Used array adapter for manualentryactivity.kt
- Used layoutkotlin for date and time picker
- app folder is myruns1 because i reused the code from myruns1, but submission is myruns3
